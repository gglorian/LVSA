# Troubleshooting

LVSA's failure modes are mostly **silent**: the run completes, an mp4 is produced, and only careful inspection reveals that the sparse path didn't engage or the geometry was wrong. This page covers the most common issues.

## Symptom 1 — No speedup (LVSA matches dense wall-clock)

**Root cause**: the LVSA backend silently fell back to dense at every block. Most often because geometry detection failed.

### Diagnosis

Look for `[LVSA-FALLBACK]` warnings in the log:

```
[LVSA-FALLBACK] origin=forward_cuda reason=geometry_detect seq_len=25740 known_ppf=[1560]
[LVSA-FALLBACK] origin=forward_cuda reason=no_t_lat seq_len=…
```

If you see no `[LVSA]` lines at all, the backend wasn't selected — check `DIFFUSION_ATTENTION_BACKEND=LVSA`.

If you see backend selection but no per-block engagement on Wan, check `LVSA_WAN_HOOK=1` (required for Wan; without it Wan's `_sp_plan` pre-shards the sequence and geometry detection fails silently).

### Fix

Set the env vars per [quickstart.md](quickstart.md). Always include `LVSA_WARN_FALLBACK=1` (default on) so silent fallbacks become visible.

For non-default resolutions, also set the geometry env vars: `LVSA_PATCHES_PER_FRAME`, `LVSA_VIDEO_HEIGHT`, `LVSA_VIDEO_WIDTH`, `LVSA_VAE_SPATIAL_FACTOR`, `LVSA_PATCH_SIZE`, `LVSA_VAE_TEMPORAL_FACTOR`.

## Symptom 2 — OOM at long sequences (T_lat ≥ 65 on 80 GB GPU)

**Root cause**: the **VAE decode** (not attention) is what blew up memory. LVSA reduces attention to ~50% of dense at 2× horizon, but the VAE then has to decode all those latent frames at once, which on HunyuanVideo at 257 video frames exceeds 80 GB even with `enable_vae_tiling()`.

### Diagnosis

The OOM trace points at `vae.decode` or `unsqueeze` inside the VAE. The attention forward will have completed cleanly.

### Fix

Use `--output-latent` (standalone) or `output_type="latent"` (vLLM-Omni Python API) to skip VAE decode and save the denoised latent tensor to a `.pt` file. Decode it offline on a higher-memory GPU.

```bash
python examples/hunyuan_generate.py \
    --model /models/HunyuanVideo-1.5-Diffusers-480p_t2v \
    --num-frames 257 --output-dir benchmarks --output-name out_2x \
    --lvsa --flashinfer --rotate-keyframes --auto-keyframes \
    --output-latent
```

The mp4 path becomes a `.pt` path; load with:

```python
import torch
data = torch.load("out_2x.pt")          # {"latent": tensor, "num_frames": 257, ...}
# Then decode with the pipeline's VAE on a higher-memory GPU
```

## Symptom 3 — Output mp4 missing after Docker run

**Root cause**: an absolute host path was passed to `--output`, which the container interprets relative to its own filesystem (not the bind-mount), so the mp4 lands inside the container and disappears with `--rm`.

### Diagnosis

The run log says `[export] /home/me/.../out.mp4 (1.4s)` but `ls /home/me/.../out.mp4` on the host returns nothing.

### Fix

Pass paths **relative to the container's working directory** (`/workdir/code` in the LVSA Docker image), and bind-mount the host repo at that path:

```bash
# WRONG — path resolves inside container, lost on --rm
docker run ... lvsa-vllm-omni:latest \
    python examples/hunyuan_generate.py --output-name /home/gael/results/out.mp4

# RIGHT — relative path, lands on host via the bind-mount
docker run ... -v $(pwd):/workdir/code -w /workdir/code ... \
    lvsa-vllm-omni:latest \
    python examples/hunyuan_generate.py --output-name benchmarks/results/out.mp4
```

Always include `&& chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) <output_dir>` at the end of the inner command so files written as root inside the container are readable on the host.

## Symptom 4 — Quality regression at training reference

**Root cause**: `LVSA_REFERENCE_LATENT_FRAMES` is wrong for your model. The auto-keyframe scheduler computed sparsity using the wrong budget, so even at training horizon you're getting partial attention coverage instead of full attention.

### Diagnosis

Check the run log:

```
[LVSA] reference_latent_frames=21  target_latent_frames=33  extension_ratio=1.57x
```

If you're running HunyuanVideo at 129 frames and you see `reference_latent_frames=21` and `extension_ratio` > 1.0 (when it should be exactly 1.0), the scheduler is using Wan's default reference. The result: per-query attended budget shrinks to ~21 instead of 33, producing ~36% accidental sparsity at training reference.

### Fix

```bash
# HunyuanVideo
LVSA_REFERENCE_LATENT_FRAMES=33

# Wan 2.x
LVSA_REFERENCE_LATENT_FRAMES=21

# CogVideoX
LVSA_REFERENCE_LATENT_FRAMES=13
```

This is the single most common LVSA configuration mistake. Always set it explicitly.

## Symptom 5 — `dynamic_quality` drops 5+ points but the user wanted quality parity

**Root cause**: this isn't a bug — it's the documented trade-off of any sparse-attention scheme. Long-range attention pairs that contribute to large-scale motion coherence are skipped, so motion-heavy prompts can lose ~5 points on VQeval `dynamic_quality` and ~0.02 points on VBench `motion_smoothness`.

### Diagnosis

Compare per-dimension VQeval numbers between dense and LVSA on the same prompt set. If `dynamic_quality` is the only dimension dropping while `loop_quality` and `text_alignment` improve, this is the trade-off.

### Fix

Three options, in order of cost:

1. **Use `sparsity_scale = 1.0`** (default). At T_lat ≤ reference this gives fully-dense attention via the LVSA path; you keep the implementation-overhead-bypass speedup (~1.5–2×) without any sparsity-driven quality cost.
2. **Increase `LVSA_WINDOW_SIZE`** from 12 to 16 video frames (4 → 5 latents). Larger window means more long-range mixing inside each query's attended set. Costs ~10% wall time.
3. **Switch to dense for motion-heavy prompts**. The `dynamic_quality` regression is highly prompt-dependent — most prompts see <2-point drops; only fast-motion prompts hit the 5-point regression.

## Symptom 6 — Very large `loop_quality` swings between methods

VQeval's `loop_quality` metric is sensitive to whether the video exhibits static / repeating content. At extended horizons, dense attention is known to drift toward static or near-periodic output (see the discussion in the paper's quality section), which depresses its loop_quality. LVSA's rotating-keyframe pattern keeps the attention set moving across denoising steps, which tends to keep loop_quality higher at extension.

Practically: large dense-vs-LVSA loop_quality gaps at extrapolation are expected and reflect the underlying failure mode of dense at those horizons, not a measurement artifact. Report both numbers side by side rather than only the delta.

## Symptom 7 — Graduated schedule env vars (`LVSA_SCHEDULE_*`) don't seem to do anything

**Root cause**: `LVSA_SCHEDULE_START` / `LVSA_SCHEDULE_END` are **soft-deprecated** in v1.0. The recommended runtime knob is `LVSA_SPARSITY_SCALE`. The schedule vars still exist for backwards compatibility (default `0`) but produce no behavior at default settings.

### Fix

Use `sparsity_scale` instead. See [`tuning.md`](tuning.md) for the supported range and trade-offs.

## Diagnostics one-liner

When something looks off, dump the LVSA-relevant log lines:

```bash
grep -E "\[LVSA" run.log | head -20
```

If the output is empty or shows only fallback warnings, walk through Symptoms 1–4 above.

## Logs to capture when filing a bug report

- Full stdout/stderr of the run
- Output of `grep -E "\[LVSA" run.log` (LVSA-specific lines)
- Output of `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used,memory.total --format=csv` mid-run (or peak), or `npu-smi info` for Ascend
- Generated mp4 / .pt file size
- Exact `docker run` command + env vars
- LVSA version: `git rev-parse HEAD` in the repo
